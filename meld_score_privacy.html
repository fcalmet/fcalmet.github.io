	<h1>Privacy Policy for Meld Score</h1>

	<p><b>Effective Date: June 6, 2025</b></p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Meld Score ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Meld Score mobile application (the "App").</p>

	<h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>

	<p>We want to be absolutely clear: <b>Meld Score does not directly collect any personal information or sensitive user data from you.</b> This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, location data, photos, contacts, device identifiers, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>

	<h2>2. Passive Data Collection by the Android Operating System</h2>

	<p>Please be aware that the Android operating system and your device may passively collect certain data for their own internal processes, performance optimization, or to provide system-level services. This data collection is handled entirely by Google (as the developer of Android) and your device manufacturer, and is outside of our control or access. Examples of such passive collection might include:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><b>Device Information:</b> General, non-identifying device information (e.g., device model, OS version) that the operating system uses for app compatibility and general functioning.</li>
	  <li><b>Performance Data:</b> Data related to app crashes or ANRs (Application Not Responding) that the Android system may collect to help developers improve app stability. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized by Google.</li>
	  <li><b>App Permissions:</b> While our app does not request any permissions that would allow us to collect your personal data, the Android system itself manages permissions.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>We do not access, store, or process any of this passively collected system data.</p>

	<h2>3. No Third-Party Services</h2>

	<p>Our App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or other services that would collect data from you.</p>

	<h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>

	<p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under 13, we will delete such information from our records.</p>

	<h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
